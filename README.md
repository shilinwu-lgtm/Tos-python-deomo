# My Test Python Project
I wrote this script to generate a large-scale test file for uploading to TOS, simulating realistic pay-in transaction data. It reads a predefined template, populates over 1.8 million records with randomized but structured values like transaction types, timestamps, and amounts, then outputs them in the required production format.
